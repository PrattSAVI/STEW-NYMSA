            The Stewardship Mapping and Assessment (STEW-MAP) project visualizes groups that help take care of the environment, or stewards, on a digital map. Our NYC STEW-MAP project closed in 2017, resulting in a <a target="_blank" href="https://usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=4d8be0bc04b649b383aa66b7bce682c0">mapped database</a>.
            Help us keep groups' contact information current - and include new groups or groups that haven't yet taken the survey. Below, you can <strong>find and edit already mapped groups (circled in green) and registered non-profits with the IRS</strong>,
            by looking at the list on the right - <strong>add a new group</strong> by clicking "Click here to add a group to the map". <u>Your participation in STEW-MAP is completely voluntary</u>. At a later stage, groups added to this map may be contacted
            for the full STEW-MAP survey, as part of an update.
            <br><br> By participating in STEW-MAP, you can help potential volunteers, public agencies, funders, and other stewards find your group and learn about what it does. You will also be able to learn about other groups doing stewardship work in
            your region.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mobile">
            This form is to collect basic information on groups' basic contact information, including where each group office or meeting space is located. You can enter your own group's information or other groups that you know of or collaborate with. <u>Your participation in STEW-MAP is completely voluntary</u>.

                According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB control number. The valid OMB control number for this information
                collection is 0596-0240. This information will be used to create an assessment of environmental stewardship activities in this community. The time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 2 minutes for individual
                responses and 15 minutes for multiple responses, including the time for locating and sharing pertinent contact information with us.</p>
